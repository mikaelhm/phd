\section{Main Contributions}
We will now briefly summarize the main contributions of this thesis within the area of component-based system specification.
First, we have introduced and defined the Asynchronous I/O Petri Nets and composition of such. Furthermore, we have introduced 14 different communication properties that assist in ensuring that component are communicating properly. We prove that these properties are all decidable for \AIOPNs and that they are preserved by composition. Second, we extend the \AIOPN formalism with modalities in order support refinement steps. We prove that this is an interesting framework for designing component-based systems, since our communication properties are preserved by both refinement and composition. In addition to this, we introduce a way to encapsulate composed components as black boxes with an open interface. This step does also preserve the communication properties and enables us to prove that a composition of specific components is in fact a refinement of a general specification.
