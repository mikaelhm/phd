\section{Main Contributions}
Before continuing with next part, we will just briefly summarize the main contribution of this thesis within the area of modal transition systems. First, we have introduced and defined the Parametric MTS formalism. Further, we have defined modal refinements of PMTS specification and done a complexity analysis and overview of modal refinement checking of PMTSs and subclasses hereof. Second, we have presented two logics to reason about Boolean MTSs and Parametric MTS. The first logic was proved to characterise BMTSs and the second can compute which configurations of a PMTS will yield a correct system specification with respect to a given requirement. Finally, we have presented a way to extend the MTS family of specifications with time and cost. This was done by adding a time duration to actions and including price scheme in the modelling formalisms. We showed how to use this additional information to check if there exists a valid system implementation within the budget.
