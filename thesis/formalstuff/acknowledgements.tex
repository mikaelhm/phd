\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:acknowledgements}

First I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Ji\v{r}\'{i} Srba. Thank you for giving me the best possible introduction to the field of formal verification during my master studies and for believing in me as a Ph.D. student. You are one of the very most thorough guys I know, and this has been a great help for me during my Ph.D. You have always been helpful, supporting and encouraging when I needed it.

An equal big thank you goes to my co-supervisor Kim Guldstrand Larsen. I am thankful for our great discussions and the fact that you have always been able to provide extra insight and additional ideas whenever I asked for your opinions.

Next I would like to send a big thank you to Rolf Hennicker for making my six month visit at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\"{a}t in Munich a very inspiring and productive stay. In this context, I would also like to thank Annabelle Klarl, Andreas Schroeder, Phillip Mayer, Christian Kroiss and Sebastian Bauer for showing me Munich, the Alps, feuerzangenbowle and in general making my visit very nice and pleasant.

During my stay in Munich I had the pleasure of working with Serge Haddad. I would like to thank you for our fruitful discussions and your deep insight in Petri Nets, which has been a great help.

I would also like to thank Nikola Bene\v{s} and Jan K\v{r}et\'{i}nsk\'{y} for our collaboration. You guys helped me get back on track when I changed the focus of my Ph.d. study. I have really enjoyed working with you and travelling with Jan in Cura\c{c}ao and Venezuela.

In December 2011, I visited ISCAS, Bejing. I would like to thank Liu Xinxin for arranging everything and for our interesting discussions.

I would also like to thank the F-klub and Hal9k. It has been vital for me to be able to flee to these places when my Ph.d. study got too stressful and troublesome. Thanks to the members of ``Madklubben'', for our fun and great lunches. A special thank you to my friends and colleges Mads Chr. Olesen and Alex Birklykke, who have been in the same situation as me. I am thankful for our discussions about the life of being a Ph.D. student, this have helped me survive the hard times of my study.

Thank you, mom and dad for supporting me and letting me choose my own future. You have always inspired me to curiosity, wonder and inventiveness. Thanks to my siblings, Jesper and Louise for all our crazy ideas.

Finally, a huge thank you Sisse, my dear girlfriend. Without you, I doubt that I would have been able to succeed in completing this Ph.D. You are always supportive when I am stressed and worn out. But most of all thank you for making my everyday life fun and cheerful. You are the best.
