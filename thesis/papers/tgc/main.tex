\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion-tgc}
We have developed a fully integrated approach for the design
of asynchronously composed component systems based on the formalism of \MAIOPNs.
Our approach
ensures that the communication properties are preserved
by asynchronous composition and by  modal refinement, the basic ingredients of the design process.
Several continuations of this work are possible. First, it would be interesting to
see how our approach works in larger case studies and concrete applications.

The ``Assume/Guarantee'' approach is a standard way to substitute a component by a behavioural interface 
in order to make easier the compositional verification. We plan to investigate
how this approach can be integrated in our framework.
Finally, broadcasting
is an appropriate communication mechanism in the asynchronous environment.
So it would be interesting to investigate how our approach can be adapted
to this communication operator.
