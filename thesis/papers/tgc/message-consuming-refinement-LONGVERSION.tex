\subsection{Refinement of Message Consuming Systems}\label{subsec:message-consuming-ref}


An important issue concerns the preservation of the message consuming properties by refinement.
We can show that this is indeed the case for modal refinement. For this purpose we need the following two lemmas.
The first lemma shows  that for any ``concrete'' reachable state there is a related ``abstract'' state with the same number of messages on each channel.
To prove the preservation of the necessarily consuming property the essential point is to show that
for any observationally weakly fair run of a concrete \MAIOTS there is a corresponding observationally weakly fair run of the abstract \MAIOTS with the same visible actions. 

% The first is a direct consequence of the modal refinement (def.~\ref{def:wmr} rule 3. and 4.).
% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:weak_step}
%     Let $\S = \maiotstupmr{\S}$ and $\T = \maiotstupmr{\T}$ be two \MAIOTS, such that $\S \mrw \T$. Let $q_\S \in \post^*(q_\S^0)$ and $q_\T \in \post^*(q_\T^0)$  such that $q_\S \mrw q_\T$, then for all $a \in \Sigmat$ the following two equations hold:
%     \begin{align}
%         q_\T \mustw{a} q'_\T \implies \exists q'_\S \;.\; q_\S \mustw{a} q'_\S\\
%         q_\S \mayw{a} q'_\S \implies \exists q'_\T \;.\; q_\T \mayw{a} q'_\T 
%     \end{align}
%     such that $q'_\S \mrw q'_\T$ in both cases.
% \end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mr-implies-equal-val}
    Let $\S$ and $\T$ be two \MAIOTSs with channels $\chan$ such that $\S \mrw \T$. Then for all $q_\S \in \reach(\S)$ there exists $q_\T \in \reach(\T)$ such that $q_\S \mrw q_\T$ and $\val_\S(q_\S,a) = \val_\T(q_\T,a)$, for all $a \in \chan$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $q_\S \in \reach(\S)$. This implies there exists $\sigma \in \Sigmat^*$ such that $q_\S^0 \may{\sigma} q_\S$. As $\S \mrw \T$ we know that $q_\S^0 \mrw q_\T^0$. Then by rule \ref{def:wmr:may:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:may:tau} in Def.~\ref{def:wmr} we get that there exists $q_\T \in \reach(\T)$ such that $q_\T^0 \lmayw{\obsa(\sigma)} q_\T$. 

    Now let $a \in \chan$. Note that $q_\S$ and $q_\T$ are both reached by the same sequence of observable actions $\obsa(\sigma)$. By the fact that silent $\tau$-transitions cannot modify the number of messages on channels we get that $\val(q_\S,a) = \val(q_\T,a)$.     
\end{proof}

The next lemma shows that for any observationally weakly fair run of a concrete \MAIOTS specification there is a corresponding observationally weakly fair run of the abstract \MAIOTS with the same visible actions. This fact is crucial to prove that the necessarily consuming property is preserved by modal refinement.
Formally, for a run $\rho$, we denote by $\visiblea(\rho)$ the sequence of visible actions occurring in $\rho$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:corr_run}
Let $\S$ and $\T$ be two \MAIOTSs such that $\S \mrw \T$.
% Let $\S = \maiotstupmr{\S}$ and $\T = \maiotstupmr{\T}$ be two \MAIOTS, such that $\S \mrw \T$.
Let $q_\S \in Q_\S$ and $q_\T \in Q_\T$  such that $q_\S \mrw q_\T$.
    Then for all $\rho_\S \in \wfrun{\S}(q_\S)$ there exists $\rho_\T \in \wfrun{\T}(q_\T)$ such that 
    $\visiblea(\rho_\S) = \visiblea(\rho_\T)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\rho_\S = q_\S \may{a_1}_\S q^2_\S \may{a_2}_\S q^3_\S \may{a_3}_\S \cdots \in \wfrun{\S}(q_\S)$ with $a_i \in \Sigmat$. Then by \ref{def:wmr:may:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:may:tau} in Def.~\ref{def:wmr} there exists a trace $\rho_\T$ of $\T$ and states $q^i_\T \in \rho_\T$ for $i \geq 2$ such that $q_\T \mayw{\overline{a_1}} q^2_\T \mayw{\overline{a_2}} q^3_\T \mayw{\overline{a_3}} \cdots$ with $q^i_\S \mrw q^i_\T$ and 
    \[
        \overline{a_i} = \begin{cases}
                        a_i &\text{if } a_i \in \Sigma\\ 
                        \epsilon &\text{if } a_i = \tau
                    \end{cases}
    \]
        Obviously $\obsa(\rho_\S) = \obsa(\rho_\T)$. We have to show that $\rho_\T$ is an observationally weakly fair run of $\T$. We distinguish the following cases:

        \paragraph{Case 1:} Assume $\rho_\S$ is finite with last state $q^n_\S$. Then $\rho_\T$ is finite with last state $q^n_\T$, and therefore $ \rho_\T$ is observationally weakly fair.
        It remains to show that $\rho_\T$ is a run of $\T$, i.e. $q^n_\T$ is a potential deadlock state. Assume that $q^n_\T$ is not a potential deadlock state. Then there exists $a \in (\Sigma \setminus \inset)$ such that $q^n_\T \mustw{a} \stateTGC$. From \ref{def:wmr:must:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:must:tau} of Def.~\ref{def:wmr} it follows that $q^n_\S \mustw{a} \stateTGC$. Then $q^n_\S$ is not a potential deadlock state of $\S$ and hence $\rho_\S$ is not a run of $\S$, which is a contradiction.

        \paragraph{Case 2:} Assume $\rho_\S$ is infinite. 
        Then $\rho_\T$ can be infinite, but also finite as explained in case~\ref{proof:rhot:finite}.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=2.\arabic*:, ref=(2.\arabic*), leftmargin=*,start=1]
            \item\label{proof:rhot:finite} Assume $\rho_\T$ is finite. Then $\rho_\T$ is observationally weakly fair and it remains to show that $\rho_\T$ is a run of $\T$.
            Since $\rho_\T$ is finite there exists $n \geq 2$ such that for all $j \geq n$ we have $q^j_\T = q^n_\T$ and hence $q^j_\S \mrw q^n_\T$ and $q^j_\S \may{\tau}_\S q^{j+1}_\S$ for all $j \geq n$.
            
            We show that $q^n_\T$, which is the last state of $\rho_\T$, is a potential deadlock state, and then $\rho_\T$ is a run of $\T$. 
            Assume that $q^n_\T$ is not at potential deadlock state of $\T$. Then there exists $a \in (\Sigma \setminus \inset)$ such that $q^n_\T \mustw{a} \stateTGC$. Since $q^j_\S \mrw q^n_\T$ for all $j \geq n$ we get, by \ref{def:wmr:must:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:must:tau} in Def.~\ref{def:wmr}, that $q^j_\S \mustw{a}\stateTGC$ for all $j \geq n$. On the other hand $q^j_\S \may{\tau}_\S q^{j+1}_\S$ for all $j \geq n$. Then $\rho_\S$ is not observational weakly fair which is a contradiction.

            \item Assume $\rho_\T$ is infinite. 
            Then $\rho_\T$ is a run of $\T$ and it remains to prove that $\rho_\T$ is observationally weakly fair.
            
            Let $a \in (\Sigma \setminus \inset)$ and $k \geq 2$ such that for all states $q'_\T \in \rho_\T$ occurring after $q^k_\T$ in $\rho_\T$ we have $q'_\T \mustw{a} \stateTGC$.
                For each state $q'_\S \in \rho_\S$ occurring after $q^k_\S$ in $\rho_\S$ there exists a state $q'_\T \in \rho_\T$ as above such that $q'_\S \mrw q'_\T$. Hence, by \ref{def:wmr:must:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:must:tau} in Def.~\ref{def:wmr}, $q'_\S \mustw{a} \stateTGC$. Since $\rho_\S$ is observationally weakly fair $a$ occurs infinitely often in $\rho_\S$ and hence also in $\rho_\T$ since $\obsa(\rho_\S) = \obsa(\rho_\T)$. Therefore $\rho_\T$ is observationally weakly fair.
        \end{enumerate}    
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:wmr-properties}
    Let $\S$ and $\T$ be two \MAIOTSs with channels $\chan$  such that $\S \mrw \T$.
Let $B \subseteq \chan$. 
If $\T$ is (necessarily) message consuming w.r.t.\ $B$, then $\S$ is (necessarily) message consuming w.r.t.\ $B$.
By definition, the theorem propagates to \MAIOPNs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $a \in B$ and $q_\S \in \reach(\S)$ such that $\val_\S(q_\S,a) > 0$.
 By Lem.~\ref{lem:mr-implies-equal-val} it follows that there exists $q_\T \in \reach(\T)$ such that $q_\S \mrw q_\T$
and $\val_\T(q_\T,a) = \val_\S(q_\S,a) > 0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We assume that $\T$ is message consuming w.r.t.\ $B$.
   Then there exist $q'_\T,q''_\T \in Q_\T$ and $\sigma \in (\Sigma \setminus \inset)^*$ such that $q_\T \mustw{\sigma}_\T q'_\T \must{\inact{a}}_\T q''_\T$. From \ref{def:wmr:must:a-tgc} and \ref{def:wmr:must:tau} in Def.~\ref{def:wmr} it follows that
 there exist $q'_\S,q''_\S \in Q_\S$ such that $q_\S \mustw{\sigma}_\S q'_\S \must{\inact{a}}_\S q''_\S$. Hence $\S$ is message consuming w.r.t. $B$.
\item We assume that $\T$ is necessarily message consuming w.r.t.\ $B$.\\
   Let $\rho_\S \in \wfrun{\S}(q_\S)$.
    By Lem.~\ref{lem:corr_run} we get that there exists $\rho_\T \in \wfrun{\S}(q_\T)$ with $\obsa(\rho_\T)=\obsa(\rho_\S)$. By assumption we know that $\inact{a} \in \rho_\T$. Since $\obsa(\rho_\T)=\obsa(\rho_\S)$ we get that $\inact{a} \in \rho_\S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
The nets in Fig.~\ref{fig:ref} show an abstract \MAIOPN $\pnN$ and a concrete \MAIOPN $\M$ with silent $\tau$-transitions.
Both nets have a single channel place $a$.
Obviously, $\M \mrw \pnN$ is a modal refinement. It is also clear that $\pnN$ is necessarily message consuming.
By Thm.~\ref{thm:wmr-properties}, $\M$ is necessarily message consuming as well.
Indeed a diverging run of $\M$ which always executes $\tau$ from a certain state on
is not observationally weakly fair (since $\inact{a}$ is then always observationally enabled by must-transitions but never taken)
and therefore needs not to be considered. 
This shows also why
weakly fair runs are not appropriate here since a diverging run of $\M$ is weakly fair (it always visits
a state in which $\inact{a}$ is not immediately enabled) but would not consume.   
\end{example}

As a consequence of Thm.~\ref{thm:wmr}.\ref{thm:wmr} and Thm.~\ref{thm:wmr-properties} our theory supports
the principle of independent implementability in the sense of~\cite{alfaroHenzinger2005}.
This fact is applied in Sect.~\ref{sec:example} to obtain the global refinement (3)  in Fig.~\ref{fig:ex-method}
from the local refinement (2).

\begin{corollary}[Independent Implementability]\label{cor:independent}
Let $\S, \T, \E$ and $\F$ be\linebreak \MAIOTSs. If $\T$ and $\F$ are (necessarily) message consuming compatible and
$\S \mrw \T$ and $\E \mrw \F$, then $\S$ and $\E$ are (necessarily) message consuming compatible and
$\S \compos \E \mrw \T \compos \F$. This holds analogously for \MAIOPNs.
