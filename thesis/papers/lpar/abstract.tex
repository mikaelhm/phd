Modal transition systems are a well-established specification formalism for
a high-level modelling of component-based software systems.
We present a novel extension of the formalism called
modal transition systems with durations where time durations are 
modelled as controllable
or uncontrollable intervals. We further equip the model with two
kinds of quantitative aspects: each action has its own
running cost per time unit, and actions may 
require several hardware components of different costs.
We ask the question, given a fixed budget for
the hardware components, what is the implementation with the cheapest long-run average reward. We give an algorithm for computing such optimal 
implementations via a reduction to a new extension of mean payoff games 
with time durations and analyse the complexity of the algorithm.
