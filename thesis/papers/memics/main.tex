\section{Conclusion and Future Work} 
We have introduced a new logic for Boolean modal transition systems (BMTS), based on Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion. The logic characterizes the modal refinement relation on BMTS, which we proved by giving the characteristic formula for a BMTS and showing that the satisfaction relation coincided with modal refinement. 

Secondly we applied the logic on parametric MTS (PMTS) as a tool to select the right truth assignment for the parameters of a PMTS, in order to fulfill a requirement. We gave a new semantic to the logic on PMTS, and showed that we can solve this problem via a maximal fix-point of a mutually recursive equation system.

By providing these results, we think that the OTS, BMTS and PMTS are all justified formalisms of the MTS specification family.

In the future we would like to investigate whether there exists an efficient algorithm for selecting the parameters of a PMTS given a requirement. One could try using BDDs or similar data structures to represent the constrains on the parameters.
