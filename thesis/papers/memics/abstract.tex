Modal transition systems (MTS) is a specification formalism with support for stepwise refinement. It is a well-studied formalism, and  several different extensions and generalizations have been developed. The original MTS has been shown to be in close relation with Hennessy-Milner Logic (HML). We will in this paper define a logic for Boolean MTS (BMTS), and present the characteristic formula for such specifications, using a version of HML with recursion. We prove that our logic characterizes the modal refinement of BMTS. Further we apply our logic on the more general Parametric MTS (PMTS), where we show how to select the parameters of a PMTS under certain requirements expressed in the logic.
