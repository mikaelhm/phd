\section{Parametric Modal Transition Systems} 
In this section we present the formalism of parametric modal
transition systems (PMTS), starting with a motivating example and continuing
with the formal definitions, followed by the general notion of
modal refinement.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work} 

We have introduced an extension of modal transition systems
called PMTS for parametric systems. 
The formalism is general enough to capture several features missing in
the other extensions, while at the same time it offers an easy 
to understand semantics and a natural notion of modal refinement
that specializes to the well-known refinements 
already studied on the subclasses of PMTS. Finally, we provided a comprehensive
overview of complexity of refinement checking on PMTS and its subclasses.

We believe that our formalism is a step towards a more applicable 
notion of specification theories based on MTS.

In the future work
we will study logical characterizations of the refinement relation,
investigate compositional properties 
and focus on introducing quantitative aspects into the model in order
to further increase its applicability.
