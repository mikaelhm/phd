Modal transition systems (MTS) is a well-studied specification formalism of 
reactive systems supporting a step-wise refinement methodology.
Despite its many advantages, the formalism as well as its currently
known extensions are incapable of expressing some practically needed aspects 
in the refinement process like exclusive, conditional and persistent choices.
We introduce a new model called parametric modal transition systems (PMTS) 
together with a general
modal refinement notion that overcome
many of the limitations and we investigate the computational complexity 
of modal refinement checking.
