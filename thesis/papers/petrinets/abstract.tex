
We consider asynchronously composed I/O-Petri nets (AIOPNs) with built-in communication channels.
They are equipped with a compositional semantics in terms of asynchronous I/O-transition systems (AIOTSs) admitting infinite state spaces.
We study various channel properties that deal with the production and consumption of messages exchanged via the communication channels and establish useful relationships between them. In order to support incremental design we show that the channel properties considered in this work are preserved by asynchronous composition, i.e. they are compositional. As a crucial result we prove that the channel properties are decidable for AIOPNs.
