\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced asynchronously composed I/O-Petri nets and we have
studied various properties of their communication channels based on a transition system semantics.
Useful links between the channel properties are established. We have shown that the channel properties are compositional
thus supporting incremental design. Moreover we have shown that the channel properties for \AIOPNs are decidable. 
This work can be extended in at least three directions. The first direction 
would introduce new operations on AIOPNs, like hiding, to design component systems
in a hierarchical way by encapsulating subsystems.
The second direction concerns more general communication schemes like broadcasting.
Finally, we want to establish conditions for the
preservation of channel properties along the ``vertical axis'' namely by refinement,
in particular within the framework of modal Petri nets as considered in~\cite{EHH12}.
